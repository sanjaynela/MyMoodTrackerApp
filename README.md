```swift
struct MoodEntry: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id = UUID()
    let date: Date
    let sleepHours: Double
    let steps: Int
    let screenTime: Double
    let mood: MoodType
}
```

### Core Components
- **MoodDataManager**: Handles data persistence and CRUD operations
- **MoodPredictorCoreML**: Core ML-powered mood prediction
- **DashboardView**: Main app interface
- **MoodChartsView**: Analytics and visualization
- **MoodEntryFormView**: Data entry interface
- **ModelInfoView**: ML model transparency and details

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 17.0+
- Swift 5.9+
- Python 3.8+ (for model training)

### Installation & End-to-End ML Workflow

#### 1. **Train and Export the Core ML Model (Python)**
- Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv mood_tracker_env
  source mood_tracker_env/bin/activate
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn coremltools
  ```
- Run the training script to generate data, train the model, and export to Core ML:
  ```bash
  python train_mood_model.py
  # This will create MoodPredictor.mlmodel in your project directory
  ```
- (Optional) Test the model in Python:
  ```bash
  python test_coreml_model.py
  ```

#### 2. **Add the Model to Xcode**
- In Xcode, right-click your app folder > **Add Files to "MyMoodTrackerApp"** > select `MoodPredictor.mlmodel`
- Ensure "Copy items if needed" and your main target are checked
- Xcode will auto-generate a `MoodPredictor` Swift class

#### 3. **Build and Run the App**
- Open `MyMoodTrackerApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode
- Build and run on your device or simulator
- The app will use the Core ML model for all mood predictions

### Usage
1. **Add Your First Entry**: Tap "Add Entry" to record your mood and daily activities
2. **Track Regularly**: Add entries daily to build your mood database
3. **Predict Mood**: Use the prediction feature to see how your activities might affect your mood
4. **Analyze Trends**: View charts and statistics to understand your patterns

## üîÑ End-to-End ML Workflow

1. **Data Generation & Model Training (Python)**
   - `train_mood_model.py`: Generates realistic mood data, trains a Random Forest model, and converts it to Core ML format (`MoodPredictor.mlmodel`).
   - `test_coreml_model.py`: (Optional) Test the exported model in Python before using it in the app.
2. **Model Integration (Xcode)**
   - Add `MoodPredictor.mlmodel` to your Xcode project (see above).
   - Xcode auto-generates Swift classes for easy integration.
3. **App Usage (Swift)**
   - The app loads the Core ML model and uses it for all mood predictions.
   - All predictions are made on-device for privacy.

## üß† Machine Learning Approach

### Current Implementation
The app uses a trained Core ML model (Random Forest) that considers:
- **Sleep Quality**: Optimal sleep (7-9 hours) boosts mood score
- **Physical Activity**: Higher step counts correlate with better mood
- **Screen Time**: Lower screen time generally indicates better mood
- **Confidence Scoring**: ML-based probability calculation

### Core ML Integration
- **Model Training**: Done in Python using `train_mood_model.py`
- **Model Conversion**: Exported to `.mlmodel` using `coremltools`
- **Model Usage**: Integrated in Swift via the auto-generated `MoodPredictor` class
- **Feature Importance**: Visual representation in the app
- **Model Transparency**: Detailed model information and insights
- **Easy Retraining**: Just rerun the Python script and replace the `.mlmodel` file

### Future Enhancements
- **Personalized Training**: Models that adapt to individual patterns
- **HealthKit Integration**: Automatic data collection from Apple Health
- **Advanced Analytics**: More sophisticated pattern recognition
