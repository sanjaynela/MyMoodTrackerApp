# MyMoodTrackerApp üì±

A privacy-first mood tracking app that uses machine learning to predict your mood based on daily activities. Built with SwiftUI and Core ML concepts.

## üåü Features

### üìä Mood Tracking
- **Daily Mood Entries**: Track your mood (Happy, Neutral, Sad) with emojis
- **Activity Data**: Record sleep hours, step count, and screen time
- **Local Storage**: All data stored locally on your device for privacy

### ü§ñ Mood Prediction
- **Core ML Integration**: Advanced machine learning predictions using Core ML
- **Confidence Scoring**: See how confident the prediction is
- **Personalized Insights**: Get actionable insights about your lifestyle
- **Model Transparency**: View feature importance and model details

### üìà Analytics & Visualization
- **Mood Trends**: Visualize your mood over time with beautiful charts
- **Statistics Dashboard**: View averages, streaks, and patterns
- **Time Range Filtering**: Analyze data by week, month, or all time

### üé® Modern UI/UX
- **SwiftUI Design**: Clean, modern interface with smooth animations
- **Dark Mode Support**: Automatically adapts to system appearance
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Easy-to-use interface for all features

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Data Models
```swift
struct MoodEntry: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id = UUID()
    let date: Date
    let sleepHours: Double
    let steps: Int
    let screenTime: Double
    let mood: MoodType
}
```

### Core Components
- **MoodDataManager**: Handles data persistence and CRUD operations
- **MoodPredictorCoreML**: Core ML-powered mood prediction
- **DashboardView**: Main app interface
- **MoodChartsView**: Analytics and visualization
- **MoodEntryFormView**: Data entry interface
- **ModelInfoView**: ML model transparency and details

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 17.0+
- Swift 5.9+

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `MyMoodTrackerApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run on your device or simulator

### Usage
1. **Add Your First Entry**: Tap "Add Entry" to record your mood and daily activities
2. **Track Regularly**: Add entries daily to build your mood database
3. **Predict Mood**: Use the prediction feature to see how your activities might affect your mood
4. **Analyze Trends**: View charts and statistics to understand your patterns

## üß† Machine Learning Approach

### Current Implementation
The app uses an enhanced heuristic-based prediction model with Core ML architecture that considers:
- **Sleep Quality**: Optimal sleep (7-9 hours) boosts mood score
- **Physical Activity**: Higher step counts correlate with better mood
- **Screen Time**: Lower screen time generally indicates better mood
- **Confidence Scoring**: Feature-based confidence calculation

### Core ML Integration
- **Model Architecture**: Ready for trained Core ML models
- **Feature Importance**: Visual representation of feature weights
- **Model Transparency**: Detailed model information and insights
- **Easy Upgrade Path**: Simple replacement with trained models

### Future Enhancements
- **Trained Core ML Models**: Replace heuristics with actual trained models
- **HealthKit Integration**: Automatic data collection from Apple Health
- **Advanced Analytics**: More sophisticated pattern recognition
- **Personalized Training**: Models that adapt to individual patterns
