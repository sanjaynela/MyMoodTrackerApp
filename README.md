- **Statistics Dashboard**: View averages, streaks, and patterns
- **Time Range Filtering**: Analyze data by week, month, or all time

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX
- **SwiftUI Design**: Clean, modern interface with smooth animations
- **Dark Mode Support**: Automatically adapts to system appearance
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Easy-to-use interface for all features

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Data Models
```swift
struct MoodEntry: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id = UUID()
    let date: Date
    let sleepHours: Double
    let steps: Int
    let screenTime: Double
    let mood: MoodType
}
```

### Core Components
- **MoodDataManager**: Handles data persistence and CRUD operations
- **MoodPredictor**: Simple ML model for mood prediction
- **DashboardView**: Main app interface
- **MoodChartsView**: Analytics and visualization
- **MoodEntryFormView**: Data entry interface

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 17.0+
- Swift 5.9+

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `MyMoodTrackerApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run on your device or simulator

### Usage
1. **Add Your First Entry**: Tap "Add Entry" to record your mood and daily activities
2. **Track Regularly**: Add entries daily to build your mood database
3. **Predict Mood**: Use the prediction feature to see how your activities might affect your mood
4. **Analyze Trends**: View charts and statistics to understand your patterns

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

### Current Implementation
The app uses a simple heuristic-based prediction model that considers:
- **Sleep Quality**: Optimal sleep (7-9 hours) boosts mood score
- **Physical Activity**: Higher step counts correlate with better mood
- **Screen Time**: Lower screen time generally indicates better mood

### Future Enhancements
- **Core ML Integration**: Replace heuristics with trained ML models
- **HealthKit Integration**: Automatic data collection from Apple Health
- **Advanced Analytics**: More sophisticated pattern recognition
